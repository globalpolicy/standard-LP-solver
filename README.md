# standard-LP-solver
Very basic standard-form Linear Program solver using Simplex method
<p>
  
 Repo for hosting the app @ https://gist.github.com/globalpolicy/56ee2deca654f6656b74fb14ea7d6e5d
<br>
I only realised I could've just pushed the app here instead of to GitHub Gist.
So, <a href="https://globalpolicy.github.io/standard-LP-solver/">here</a> it is.
